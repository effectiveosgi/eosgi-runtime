Effective OSGi Runtime: INI Configuration
=========================================

The Ini file format will be familiar to Windows users. The format is essentially
a Java properties file but with labelled sections, for example:

```INI
[http]
host=127.0.0.1
port=80
protocol=http

[https]
host=0.0.0.0
port=80
protocol=https
keyStorePath=${user.name}/.keystore
```

If zero section headers are present then the properties in the file are used to
populate a Singleton Configuration with a PID derived from the file name. If one
or more named sections appear then each section defines a single configuration
record inside a Factory Configuration.

A file using this format must be named with the `.ini` extension. The PID or the
Factory PID is derived from the filename by dropping the extension.

### Property Value Types

The Ini file reader loads each property value either as a string
(`java.lang.String` or a string array (`java.lang.String[]`). No other property
types are supported â€” if more flexible types are needed then it is recommended
to use the Configurator JSON format (see [below](#configurator-json-format)).

To create a String array value, simply repeat the property name, e.g.:

```INI
languages=en
languages=fr
languages=de
```

The `languages` property will have the value `{"en", "fr", "de"}`. It is not
possible to create a single-element string array as this will always be
interpreted as a simple string.

### Property Substitution

Property substitution is supported using the format
`${section/property[index]}`, which can be embedded anywhere in a property
value. Where the section name is omitted then the current section is assumed and
where the index is omitted the last value is used. So in the following example:

```INI
[http.server]
host=localhost
host=10.0.0.1
port=8080

[http.client]
path=/index.html
url=http://${http.server/host[0]}:${http.server/port}${path}
```

... the `url` property in the `http.client` section shall be resolved as
`http://localhost:8080/index.html`.

The following special section names can be used:

* `?` refers to the root context, i.e. outside of any section. In a factory
  configuration file this root section is not used directly, so it is a good
  place to store any shared values.
* `@prop` refers to Java system properties;
* `@env`refers to environment variables.

For example:

```INI
# Common values...
app=myapp
global.logDir=${@env/SYSTEM_LOG}/${app}/logs
local.logDir=${@prop/user.home}/.${app}/logs

[server1]
accessLog=${?/global.logDir}/access.log

[server2]
accessLog=${?/log.dir}/access.log
```

* `server1/accessLog` resolves to the value of the SYSTEM_LOG environment
  variable plus `myapp/logs/access.log`.
* `server2/accessLog` resolves to the user's home directory plus
  `.myapp/logs/access.log`.
